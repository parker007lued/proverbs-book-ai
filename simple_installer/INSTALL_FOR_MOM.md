# Simple Installation Guide - For Your Mother

## 📦 What You Need

Just **one file**: `install.py`

## 🚀 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Get the File
- You'll receive a file called `install.py`
- Save it anywhere on your computer (Desktop is fine)

### Step 2: Run It
**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal (Applications → Utilities → Terminal)
2. Type: `python3 ` (with a space at the end)
3. Drag the `install.py` file into the Terminal window
4. Press Enter
5. Enter your password when asked
6. Wait for installation (5-10 minutes)

**Or double-click** `install.py` if Python is set up to run scripts

### Step 3: Use It
- A web browser will open automatically
- The interface appears in your browser
- Start creating your book!

## ✨ What Happens Automatically

1. ✅ Installs Ollama (for AI text)
2. ✅ Installs Pandoc (for PDF/ebook export)
3. ✅ Downloads AI model (takes a few minutes)
4. ✅ Opens the web interface
5. ✅ Ready to use!

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select a chapter number** (1-31)
2. **Choose content type** (Commentary, Summary, or Devotional)
3. **Click "Generate Chapter"**
4. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for AI to write
5. **Review and edit** the generated text
6. **Repeat** for more chapters
7. **Click "Export Book"** when done

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
- Mac usually has Python pre-installed
- If not, download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### "Permission denied"
- Right-click the file
- Select "Open With" → "Python Launcher"
- Or run in Terminal with: `python3 install.py`

### Browser doesn't open
- Manually go to: http://localhost:8000

### Something doesn't work
- Make sure you have internet connection
- Try running the script again
- Check that all installation steps completed

## 💡 Tips

- **First run takes longer** (downloading AI model)
- **Keep Terminal open** while using the app
- **Internet needed** for AI model download (only once)
- **All your work saves** in the browser

## 🎉 That's It!

This is the simplest way to use the application. Just run one file and everything works!
